# Predictive Modeling for Sales Prediction

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a predictive model for sales prediction using regression techniques. The dataset used comprises sales data with various features such as item details, outlet information, and sales figures.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes reading and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, consolidating categories, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing data distributions, visualizing relationships between variables, and identifying key insights.
- **Model Training**: Building regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and performing K-Fold Cross Validation.
